Advice
======

Prospective Students
--------------------

If you want to join the undergradate program at Purdue, please
understand that Dr. Lu has no influence about the admission. In fact,
he does not even know who is involved in the admission process for
undergraduate students. Please do not ask Dr. Lu knows nothing about
the admission of the undergraduate program.

Dr. Lu is a member of the admission committee for graduate students in
the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He makes
recommendations about the applications but he has no authority making
the final decisions.  Here are some commonly asked questions and his
answers.



About Financial Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most students do not know how universities operate in terms of
finance. As a result, they think professors magically have unlimited
funds to support as many students as the professors decide. Before you
ask Dr. Lu to provide financial support, please be aware of the
following facts:

- Dr. Lu does not print money. Research fund does not fall from sky like rain drops.
  
- Purdue University does not give students' tuition to professors for
  doing research. The tuition goes to facilities such as computer
  networks, buildings, furniture, electricity, staff, administration,
  cleaning ...
  
- For every $100 Dr. Lu spends on research (including machines, travel
  to conferences, salary for students ...), Purdue takes $55 for
  facilities such as computer networks, buildings, furniture,
  electricity, cleaning ... Thus, Dr. Lu has to request $155 from
  project sponsors.
  
- Purdue does not give research money to professors because the
  professors have a lot of students.
  
- Dr. Lu works with many students because he wants to give more
  students research experience. He enjoys the intellectual
  interactions with many excellent students. He also thinks the
  interactions among students help them succeed. The size of his
  research team has no effect on how much Purdue gives him for
  research (always $0).
  
- Dr. Lu has zero influence about how Purdue spends tuition. Please
  talk to Purdue President if you have any suggestions.
  
- Dr. Lu has zero influence on other professors' decisions. Dr. Lu
  cannot tell any other professor to give any student financial
  support.
  
- Dr. Lu obtains research funding by writing proposals.
  
- Financial supports are divided into three types: fellowship,
  teaching assistantship, and research assistantship. Dr. Lu has no
  control of fellowship or teaching assistantship.
  
- Research assistantship is a type of employment: a research assistant
  is an employee of Purdue University for conducting research
  described in the corresponding research proposal.  If you do not do
  what is written in the proposal, you cannot receive research
  assistantship.

- Professors provide research assistantship because the work in the
  proposals have to be carried out, not because professors are "nice".

- Financial support is not free money and students do not have
  complete freedom doing whatever they want.
  
- If anyone goes to a bank office and says, "Give me money.", this
  person has committed a crime called robbery. Why do some students go
  to professors and ask for money?

- Dr. Lu has no obligation to give you financial support. You have to
  earn it.  Getting financial support from Dr. Lu will take you a lot
  of efforts. He will not give you money because you send an email.
  
  
- Dr. Lu can support only Purdue students. 
  
Research Topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Do not go to Dr. Lu and say, "I will to study this topic."  Dr. Lu
  has a large established research program. You must do what the
  research program needs. He does not care about your new ideas.
  
- Dr. Lu emphasizes teamwork greatly. You have to work with a
  team. You must have good communication skills.

- Prepare to have multiple, long, and deep technical discussions.

- Read at least five of his papers published in the last three
  years. Do not initiate any conversation before you finish reading
  the papers.


Purdue Students
---------------

Dr. Lu has a large research team (usually above 60 students). Before
you join his team, please read this carefully.



Potential Entreprenurs
----------------------



Potential Faculty Members
-------------------------

Some students want to become professors. That's great. However, it is
important to understand what professors do. Some people tell me that
they want to become professors because they "love teaching".  The
truth is that professors do many things other than teaching.







HOW TO Become a Member in this Team
===================================


Dr. Lu's research team creates leaders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mission of this research team is to create leaders.

Many of the world's problems can be attributed to the lack of
leadership.  Many excellent people have scientific knowledge or
technical skills but no leadership or communication skills. True
experts do not know how to explain. Many experts focus on the
technical details without the ability to see "big pictures".
Meanwhile, some people with no knowledge about a topic or have no
scientific training speak loudly for the purpose of attracting
attention or obtaining personal gains.  "In the absence of genuine
leadership, people listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone."
(from the movie "The American Presient")

Before You Send Email to Dr. Lu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Dr. Lu (almost every professor) receives too many meaningless
   messages from careless students. In most cases, the students do not
   even know where the messages are sent to. Many messages ask to join
   Dr. Lu's research team even though Dr. Lu has never done anything
   on the topics of the senders' interest. Dr. Lu will not respond to
   these messages. Dr. Lu will respond to only questions from the
   students that are already at Purdue or have already received
   admissions from Purdue. If you are not at Purdue, please contact
   the admission office. Dr. Lu will not answer questions like "Can I
   get an admission to Purdue?" or "Can you give me funding?"

Before you contact Dr. Lu, ask yourself these questions:

- Do I know what this research team is doing?
  
- Have I read this team's recent papers?
  
- Do I want to conduct research on these topics?
  
- Can I contribute to solving the research problems?
  
Do not send email to Dr. Lu if you have no answer. 


Should you do research? Research, like any other activities that
require long-term efforts (such as marathon, chess, painting...), is
not for everyone. "Everyone should do research." is as valid as
"Everyone should run marathon." or "Everyone should play chess."
Before you join a research team, think about the reasons. What do you
want to accomplish? Why do you want to do research with this team?
Remember, time is your most precious asset. Do you want to spend your
time with these people? Why? Do these people want to spend time with
you? Why?


This research team gives students (including undergraduate students)
the true experience of research. You will be given research problems,
not classroom homework assignments. You need to solve these research
problems and have contributions to the research community (such as
research papers, open-source software, data). This is a large research
team in the number of students. You will get the opportunity
to learn from other students, making life-long friends, solving
problems that are too difficult for small teams.

For graduate students: This team has many undergraduate students and
you can get rare experience working with these students solving large
research problems. They may help you review literature or conduct
experiments. They may critique your methods. You may get the
opportunity leading a team.

It is expected that you are comfortable writing computer programs. You
should have the skills equivalent to ECE 264 (or CS 240) at Purdue. CS
159 is insufficient. You must be able to learn Python.

Research requires a lot of self learning. If you learn in classroom
only and need step-by-step guidance by teaching assistants, you are
not ready for research.

This research team provides unique experience that is uncommon on campus:
all students (including undergraduate students) solve research
problems. Since research problems are difficult, this team has the
following requirements:

- Every student is expected to stay for at least two semesters (summer
  counts as a semester). Many students stay in the team for 2 years or
  even longer. Why? They want to solve research problems. If you
  intend to stay for only semester, do not come.  One semester is too
  short to accomplish anything meaningful.  Do not waste your time.
  
- Every new member will receive fast-pace training. This takes the
  efforts of current members.
  
- During spring or fall semester, every new member must take a
  research course (ECE 279, 379, 479, CS 490, or similar). The reason
  is simple: without taking a research course, new members always
  vanish when their coursework becomes heavy.  

- Teamwork is absolutely critical.  If you want to work alone, do not
  come.  

- Every member must make a commitment to solving research
  problems. This team demands serious efforts.

- Research must create new things (new software, new data, new theory,
  new algorithms, new interpretation...). If you do not create
  anything new, you are not doing research. "New" means new to human
  knowledge, not new to you. If your only intention is to "learn"
  without solving research problems, do not come. 

- Members are expected to interact in both professional and social
  settings. Many solutions are discovered when people talk outside
  research laboratories. Communication with your team is an essential
  part of research. The social events are important parts of member
  interactions. If you do not want to participate in any social event,
  do not join this research team.

- This is a research team. It is not an amusement park. This team
  solves research problems and does not host tourists. Join this team
  only if you want to solve research problems. Spend at least six
  hours per week on the research project and attend weekly team
  meetings.  Many students treat "research" as visiting an amusement
  park. They are looking for "fun" without the intention of taking
  serious efforts. They show up when they want to; they leave at any
  moment. They expect to get A easily. This research team does not
  need those people. This research team welcomes only the people that
  are serious about solving research problems. 

- Report progress in writing and speaking.  Research, by definition,
  is to discover new things. Thus, you must explain what you have
  discovered by speaking and writing.

- This research team does not accept students that come with their own
  agenda. This team solves research problems that take long time. The
  topics have been determined long before any new member joins the
  team.  As a new member, you are not allowed to suggest new
  topics. The team does not care what you want to do. As a new member,
  you must solve the problems that have already been selected by the
  team.

- Some students ask meaningless questions like "How many hours do I
  need to spend per week?" There is no answer.  The answer depends on
  "What do you want to accomplish?" You need to spend at least six
  hours a week. If you cannot, you are wasting your time because you
  can accomplish nothing.  Many people spend much more than six hours
  a week because they want to solve difficult problems. If you are
  leading a research paper, it is possible that you spend 30 hours (or
  more) per week for several weeks before the submission.

- Doing research is like climbing high mountains or competiting in the
  World Cup? Do you want to accomplish something extraordinary?  This
  team gives members friendship with excellent researchers, authorship
  of research papers, strong recommendation letters, excellent job
  offers, and occasionally, pizza. Above everything else, **this team
  gives members the pride of solving research problems**.

- Every new member must take a research course. There is no exception.
  Do not ask. 

  
Research is NOT Classroom Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A research group is fundamentally different from a classroom. A
classroom is usually an inclusive environment: most instructors allow
auditors. In contrast, a research team is a "privileged" environment
and only selected members can participate.  Many reasons make research
team restrictive, for example,

- The members in the team use the facilities that are purchased using
   research fund obtained by the research proposals written by the
   professors.
   
-  The members must have ability to understand and improve
   state-of-the-art solutions.
   
-  The members are inventing a new solution that may lead to a
   patent. Before this patent is filed and granted, the members must  
   protect the intellectual properties.
   
-  The members are writing a research paper and everyone must be
   qualified to contribute to the content.

If you like sports, you need to ask yourself a simple question: "Am I
ready to join a professional team?" This research team is professional
because the team solves research problems that have not been solved by
anyone yet. If you are not ready to contribute, you will not enjoy the
experience and current team members cannot work with you.

This is a research team. You come to solve research problem. You do
not come to learn. If you want to learn, go to take courses or read
books. This team does not accept anyone that wants to join and learn,  
without contributions to solving research problems. This team accepts 
only the people that wants to solve research problems. Please **evaluate
whether you are ready to contribute.**

Differences between Students and Researchers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before joining this team, please make sure you understand the differences
between students and researchers.  A student with high GPA is not
necessarily a good researcher. Some excellent researchers do not have
high GPA.  Why? Because taking classes and doing research are very
very different.

How does a student get a good grade? Usually, by submitting
assignments and answering exam questions. Due to the semester
structure, a course can last only 15 weeks. As a result, every
assignment has to be finished within several weeks. Also, most exam
questions are limited to well-defined problems that can be answered
within one or two hours.  This structure has tremendous impacts on how
students think.  Many students (mistakenly) think everything can be
done within a few weeks because students never have experience doing
anything longer than a few weeks. Most students cannot comprehend the
complexity of any problem that takes more than several weeks.

Research is almost the opposite of everything in
classroom. The following table summarizes the main differences between
"student thinking" and "researcher thinking":

Self Assessment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you join this team, answer the following questions. These
questions help you decide whether this team is right for you.  If you
cannot answer any of these questions, you are not ready to join this
team.  Please do not intend to memorize answers. You should
**understand**.


.. note::

   If you are not ready to do research now, that's all right. Come back later.



Teamwork
~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Communication and interaction is more important than any technical
   skill.  If you cannot communicate, it does not matter what you
   know.

- How do you respond to discussion and critique?

- Have you worked in a team project? How big was the team?

- Do you think using jargon and acronyms to ensure that nobody can
  understand you would make people believe that you are knowledge,
  smart, and superior?

- How would you respond when someone tells you that you have made a
  mistake?

- When you disagree with someone, what would you do?

- When someone disagrees with you, what would you do?

- What would you do when you cannot finish a task that is assigned to
  you?

- What would you do when you finish a task early?

- What would you do if a team member cannot finish an assigned task?

- How would you inform team members your progress or problems you
  encounter?

- What would you do if you think an assigned task is not worth doing,
  or should be done in a different way?

- Have you participated in a project in which members'
  responsibilities were adjusted as needs arose?

- Can you describe the ideal characteristics of team members? Are you
  a good team member? Why?

- Did you have experience working with a difficult team member? Why is
  this member difficult? What did you (or anyone else in the team) do
  to manage the situation?

- How would you handle the situation when a team member is
  intelligent, highly-motivated, has solid technical skills but does
  something that is not the team's priority?

- When a team member writes a report that does not provide sufficient
  details for you to work together, what would you do? How would you
  prevent this from happening?



Past Project Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- What are your past projects? What did you do? Is it an individual
  project or a team project? What are your contributions?

- What knowledge and skills do you have? Why do you think you can
  contribute to research?

- Can you describe the factors that made your past projects successful
  or unsuccessful?

- If you could redesign one of your past projects from the beginning,
  what differences would you make?



Logic Thinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Alice is younger than Bob. Bob is younger than Cathy. Thus, Alice is
  definitely younger than Cathy.

- Alice and Bob are friends. Bob and Cathy are friends. Thus, Alice
  and Cathy are definitely friends.

- It has been observed that owners of luxurious vehicles are richer
  than average people. Thus, if a person wants to become rich, this
  person should purchase a luxurious vehicle.

- Alice says, "If an event is observed, it is definitely possible."
  Bob says, "The opposite is also true. If an event is never observed,
  it is definitely impossible." Which one is correct? Alice? Bob?
  Both? Neither?

- A pharmaceutical company wants to understand the effects of a new
  medicine. The researchers give this new medicine to lab animals and
  nothing else. Within six days, all lab animals are dead. The
  researchers conclude that the medicine is toxic and should never be
  used for treatment. Do you agree with this conclusion? Explain your
  answer.


Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Briefly describe binary search.

- How is binary search done in a sorted array? How is binary search done in a binary search tree?

- What is the best case (in terms of time or the number of operations)
  when doing binary search in a sorted array? What is the worst case
  when doing binary search in a sorted array?

- What is the best case when doing binary search in a binary search
  tree? What is the worst case when doing binary search in a binary
  search tree?

- In a graph with positive weights for the edges, describe an
  algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. Hint: "Dijistra's algorithm" is not an acceptable answer. An acceptable
  answer must describe how the algorithm works.

- Suppose you have an algorithm that finds the shortest paths in a
  graph of positive weights for edges. Will the algorithm find the
  longest paths, without cycles, in a graph of positive weights for
  edges if you replace `>` by `<=` or `>` by `>=`? Explain the reason.

- Continue from the previous question. Describe an algorithm to find
  the longest path between two vertices without any cycle. Why is it
  important to emphasize that cycles are not allowed?

- Why is quicksort quick? 


Data structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Binary tree is a widely used data structure. Why is "binary"
  sufficient? Is trinary tree better? In what ways? Why do most books
  not emphasize trinary tree?

- Describe two ways in a computer program to store a graph. Explain
  the advantage and disadvantage of these two ways.

- Describe two sorting algorithms. Explain the advantage and
  disadvantage of these two algorithms.

- You need to design sorting algorithms for two different scenarios.

#. The machine has a very large amount of memory (with uniform access 
   time) and all data can fit into the memory.

#. The amount of data exceeds the memory capacity and thus only part  
   of the data can fit in memory. The rest of the data must reside on 
   much slower disks.

Will the sorting algorithms be different for these two scenarios?
Why? How?

- Describe the most important difference between a linked list and a
  binary tree. Why is this the most important?

- What are the differences between a list and an associate array? When
  do you use one or the other?

- How do you implement an associative array?

- Two binary tree have the same shape if they have the same numbers of
  nodes on the left and the right sides at each level. For `n`
  distinct numbers, there are `n!` different permutations. If these
  numbers form binary search trees, how many different shapes will
  there be? Is that `n!`?

- How do you store a very large matrix whose most elements are zero?
  What matrix operations are easy in this data structure?
  What operations are difficult? Why?


Programming (independent of language)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- What is stack memory? How is it used?

- What is heap memory? How is it used?

HOW TO Be A Successful Researcher and Leader
============================================

How To Choose Research Topics
-----------------------------

Prepare a Research Canvas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Research Model Canvas" (RMC) is inspired by the "Business Model Canvas" in the book "Business Model Generation". The book says, "A business model describes the rationales of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value." 

The purpose of RMC is to ask several essential questions about a research project. The answers can help the members in the research team, as well as outsiders, understand the most important components of the research project. Although there are common elements to business and research (with research being a business in its own right), there are aspects of research that differ from business, which is why we have created the RMC.

We have prepared a `Research Model Canvas Template in Google Slides <http://bit.ly/research-model-canvas>`__ that you can use to organize a RMC for your project. Regardless of where you are in the research journey, you should consider preparing an RMC, which is a great way to engage your team and organize your research ideas with the goal of realizing maximum impact.  For those of you working with Profs. Lu and Thiruvathukal, you are encouraged to prepare and share your RMC at the earliest opportunity.


Choose Now, So That You Can Choose Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common problem among many students (in fact, most people) is that
they cannot decide. Many people hesitate to choose because they are
afraid of choosing something wrong and then regret later. Some studies
suggest that people feel less happy when they have more options. In
some retail experiments, customers leave without buying anything if
too many items are on sale.

Imagine the following scenario. You want to select a place for the
next vacation.  You cannot possibly be in two different places at the
same time and you cannot decide. As a result, you sit at an airport
without going anywhere.  "This is funny and stupid.", you may
say. However, many people do that: they are afraid of making decisions
and instead sit at airports without going anywhere.

Many students say, "I don't know what I want to do. Thus, I am not
going to choose." This thinking is wrong in multiple ways:

- First, you have already chosen a major. 
- Second, you have already chosen to study at Purdue University.
- Third, you have already chosen to join Dr. Lu's research team.
- Fourth, you have already chosen to read this page right now.

Everything has a cost. The highest cost is time because nothing can get time back. When you are reading this page right now, you have already been spending the most precious resource of your life: time. You have already made the decision to spend this moment this way.

When students join research teams, they may face the options of choosing topics. Here are some common misunderstanding about choosing research topics:

- Students decide research topics. Some students think research means
  disappearing from civilization for several years, coming out "crazy
  ideas", and completely changing the world after they reappear. This
  is wrong. First, it is unlikely that you can disappear from
  civilization; you still need access to the Internet, right? Second,
  it is unlikely that you can come out crazy ideas alone. Third, even
  if you can come out crazy ideas, you need to validate the ideas and
  compare them with existing studies. Maybe some people have already
  done similar things when you are hiding.
  
- If a student chooses a topic, the student cannot change the topic
  for the next forty years. Once in a while, a person makes a major
  breakthrough in science and gives a speech about the process to the
  success. The person may say, "I have been solving this problem for
  forty years since I was a student."  These cases are rare (that's
  why they are reported in news). It is common that a researcher changes
  topics as technologies become mature, new technologies (and
  problems) are created, or simply because these researchers change
  their interests.

The most important factor of deciding research topics is the needs of
the research teams, not a student's preference. A research team is
often similar to a baseball team. If the team needs a left field now,
you have to fill that position, or you are out of the team. The
research topics are decided by professors according to multiple
factors, for example, the existing expertise of the teams, the
projection of the teams' future needs, etc. It is rare that a
professor allows a student to choose a topic without any
boundary. 

Many students think not choosing any topic gives them the freedom to
choose something else later. This is also wrong for multiple reasons:

- If you do not choose a research topic now, you may have no options
  later. If you want to attend a graduate school, research experience
  can be very helpful getting admissions (and financial supports). If
  you do not choose a topic, you may not receive the admission from
  the university you want to attend. As a result, you do not have the
  option of attending that university.

- If you do not choose a research topic now, you may not stand out in
  job interviews. As a result, you do not have the option of joining
  the company you like.

- Most important, if you do not choose a topic now, you may never know
  which topic you actually like.  If you are an outsider, you do not
  know the good and bad things about a particular research topic. As a
  result, you have no information to make the best decision for you.

"How to choose a topic?", you may ask. The best answer is **"Just do
it"**. The best way to know whether you like a research topic is to
start doing it. Read research papers. Repeat the experiments. Derive
the formulas. Talk to the people doing this research. Just do it. You
will likely determine, within a few weeks, whether you really hate it.
If you do not do it, you will never know whether you like it or not.

Choice is a Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people imagine that they could choose the best pieces among
different options. That is usually not possible. If you like to travel
around the world, you have to tolerate flight delays, jetlags, etc. If
you like to live in a city, you have to tolerate traffic. Every choice
is a "package". Everything in the package comes together. Each
research team has specific culture and style of doing research. Some
teams emphasize teamwork. Some other teams encourage students to work
independently. Some professors usually write short papers (2-4
pages). Some professors usually write long papers (10 pages or
longer). Some professors' papers have many equations. Some professors'
papers have no equation. Some professors expect students to appear
during daytime; some other professors do not care if students appear
only between dinner and breakfast.  Some research teams need to write
software. Some research teams need field studies. When you join a
research team, you embrace all these into your topic.

Do Not Chase "Hot" Topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many students choose "hot" topics. They choose topics based on the popular terms in news. This has many problems. First, a hot topic means many people are working on it. When these students graduate, there may be over supply of talents and jobs may be hard to find. Second, a hot topic must be a hard topic. Easy things cannot be hot because everyone can do it and there is nothing to talk about. That means a hot topic takes a lot of effort to understand and to master.

Hot topics inevitably becomes cold.

Spend some time understanding the history of a research topic. Some
topics become hot, cold, hot, cold over multiple decades. A topic may
be hot for a while, many people work on the topic and solve easy
problems.  Then, the remaining problems are too hard and people stop
(hence, the topic becomes cold). Some years later, a major
breakthrough occurs and the topic becomes hot again. You need to
understand these cycles. Breakthroughs are made by those people that
are willing to continue when the topic becomes cold and most people
have left that topic.

When you choose a research topic, you need to know your personality. Do you like more conceptual problems, or you prefer something tangible? You also need to know the restrictions imposed on you. If you have two semesters before graduation, you should not intend to solve a problem at the scale of a doctoral thesis. In most cases, students do not have the knowledge or experience choosing the right scale of problems. They should discuss with professors.

Understand the Four Stages of Doing Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It has been observed that most students go through four stages when they do research:

- Excitement due to ignorance. New researchers are always excited when
  they encounter new problems. They have not started and have
  not encounter any obstacles. They are ready to change the world by
  their endless energy and unlimited optimism.

- Frustration and disappointment with knowledge. The first stage may
  last several days to several weeks. After reading research papers,
  the researchers lose excitement. They realize "Everything I want to
  do has been done."  The more they read, the more frustrated they
  become. They conclude that they are late about everything. Anything
  that is worth doing has already been published.

- Experiments and failures. The second stage may last several weeks to
  many months. Most people give up during the second stage. Some think
  deeply enough and move to the third stage. They identify things that
  have not been published. They think of ways to improve existing
  solutions. They try these improvements and compare these new methods
  with existing methods. The new methods do not work at all, or are
  worse than the existing methods.

- Improvement and innovation. The third stage may last several months
  to forever. Reading more papers usually does not help getting out of
  the third stage. Staying in office or laboratory is often not
  productive. Improvements and innovations usually come from
  non-routine activities: attend a seminar, do exercise, watch a
  sci-fi movie, talk to strangers, listen to podcast, take a short
  vacation, attend a conference ... Research has shown that people are
  more innovative when they break their daily routines.

How to get out of Stage 2 and Stage 3? There is no method that always
works. Here are several suggestions that can help:

- Talk to experts. If you find a paper that is truly inspiring,
  contact the first author and ask whether you can talk by video call
  for 10 minutes. Of course, you have to read the paper very carefully
  and understand most of the context. Don't ask trivial
  questions. Instead, ask questions about directions, such as "What
  direction would you suggest to take?" "What mistakes would you
  suggest to avoid?" Use you @purdue.edu email. DO NOT USE @gmail.com.
  Studies have shown that strangers are more willing (about three
  times more) to help students. If you use @purdue.edu, you increase
  your chance of response to about 15%. If you use @gmail.com, you
  have only 5% chance getting responses.

- Talk to non-experts.  Sometimes it can help if you talk to people
  that know nothing about your topic.  These people may ask surprising
  questions and open new thinking.  Do not intend to do everything
  alone.  Sleeping less and working longer hours usually does not
  help.
  
- Pay attention to details. Maybe all existing studies use images
  taken indoors. If you use outdoor images, will anything change?
  Maybe published studies are conducted on sunny days. If you do the
  study on a rainy day, will anything change?

- Create a table comparing different methods. What are similar and
  different among the published methods?

- Repeat published studies. You may get different results because you
  take slightly different approach and the details are not
  published. Discover the differences.

Read biographies of great inventors. Learn how they solve problems.

Talk to People: Does Anyone Care?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academia has many studies that are completely irrelevant and nobody
cares.  Why? Some researchers imagine some problems, solve these
problems, and publish papers. Some other researchers read the papers
and improve the solutions, without asking deep questions. Over years,
many papers are published on these topics but these results will never
be adopted in the "real world".  Many people do research for the only
purpose of writing papers. Dr. Lu does not.  Dr. Lu wants to conduct
research that can improve the world.

It is certainly admirable pursuing knowledge for the sake of
knowledge, and nothing else. Please notice the difference between
research for knowledge and research for writing papers.

However, if you think you are solving a
problem to help people, you need to know whether people actually care
about that problem.

Many studies have been conducted about how to identify worthwhile
problems to solve. One method is to talk to people "in the field". If
you think you are solving a problem important to some people, find
these people and talk to them. They may tell you the problem is indeed
important, or not.  You need to talk to strangers, not your family
members, classmates, or friends. Strangers are more likely to be
honest to you, giving you answers you do not like (such as, "I do not
care about this problem.").


Go to Linkedin and find these people. Talk to them for 5-10 minutes by
video or phone call. Often, you need to talk many people before you
converge to a problem worth solving. Some studies suggest that you
need to talk to 100 people to determine whether a problem is worth
solving:

- The first 20-30 people help you understand what questions you want to ask

- The next 20-30 people help you identify the right people to ask

- Another 20-30 people help you narrow down the problem to something
  specific and avoid distractions (related but unimportant problems)

- Finally, 20-30 more people help you identify the most important
  problem to solve

How long does this process take? If you talk to 3-4 people per day, you
will spend about 3 months.

"This is a total waste of time", you may say.

The question is what would happen if you do not ask these questions.

If you do not ask these questions, you may spend several years solving
a problem and nobody cares what you have done.

An efficient way meeting many people is to attend a large conference
or a trade show. You may talk to 20 people on a single day.

**This research team encourages you to talk to people.** Take notes in
every conversation. If you talk to 100 people, you will have the
confidence that you have identified a problem that is worth your time
solving.

"Fail Fast"
~~~~~~~~~~~

One concept from the business world is to "Fail Fast": Do not select a
very complex problem that requires many years to solve.  Instead,
breaking this complex problem into many small problems and determine
how to evaluate success often and quickly.  Every small problem helps
you determine whether you are in the right direction or not.

Researchers can learn from the movie industry: Before selecting casts
and picking up cameras, a movie studio first draw a *story board*
illustrating the plot of a story.  If this is not an attractive story,
stop and consider a different story. If this story is worth pursuing
some more details are added.  After a lot of details have already been
figured out by drawing the story board, the studio starts selecting
casts and crew.  A story board allows researchers to evaluate many
problems without investing a lot of time to each.

Another concept from business is "Fake it before you make it." Imagine
that you can to build a computer program with user interfaces.  You
can first build the front page with buttons, textboxes, menu...
*without* building anything else.  Show this front page to potential
users.  It is possible that nobody likes the user interface and nobody
will use the program.  It is unnecessary building the rest of the
program because there is no user. When you build a complex system, you
need to build a few small parts, "fake" some unbuilt parts so that you
can test what has already been built. If you do not fake those parts,
you cannot test what you have built.

The concept of "fail fast" forces researchers to think critically what
is the most important and evaluate whether that is indeed worth
doing. Make a little progress and then evaluate again. In many cases,
"great ideas" are not worth pursuing because nobody cares (other than
writing papers citing each other's work).


Why Don't Professors Just Give Problems to Students?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some students want professors to give problems, like homework
assignments in classrooms. This is not ideal because nobody (even
"professors") can know all the most recent progress.  The ability to
identify a problem worth solving is an important skill for students to
learn.  Students need to become thinkers, not only doers.



How To Give Progress Reports
----------------------------

Research is fundamentally different from classroom learning. Please review
(you should have already read it before joining this team)


Differences Between Progress Reports and Homework Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Progress reports are not homework assignments. The following table compares the difference

+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Research Progress Reports                                  | Homework Assignments                                   |
+============================================================+========================================================+
| Each  member solves unique problems                        | Everyone solves the same problem                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Need to explain how to evaluate success                    | Grading criteria are given by professors               |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Often encounter unexpected obstacles and take long time    | Assignments can usually be done within a few days      |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Why? Explain to the team                                   | Why? Professors assign the problems                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| What? Explain to the team                                  | What? Professors assign the problems                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| To inform other members of the progress and difficulty     | To inform the instructor that "I know the answer."     |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| A research problem cannot be solved easily                 | Most homework problems can be solved by studying       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Require a lot of thinking                                  | Attend lectures, read textbooks, talk to TAs           |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+


Essential Components of Good Technical Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- First, give a meaningful title that describes your work. Read the
  title once, slowly.  The title should not be "Progress" or "Progress
  Report".

- Second, explain the problem (or problems) you are solving. Nobody
  knows exactly what you are doing. Do not assume anyone knows the
  problems. Do not assume that your team leader or professor knows the
  problem. You have to explain.

- Why do you solve this problem? Why does this team need your
  solution? How is this problem related to other problems solved by
  other team members? Again, do not say, "I solve this problem because
  my leader told me to." or "The professor told me to do this."  You
  need to understand "Why".

- What has been done? What are the alternatives? Why are existing
  solutions insufficient? What problems, in the context of existing
  solutions, do you solve?

- What is your solution? Give details. Nobody knows what you are
  doing. Your presentation needs to explain details. Do not assume
  that everyone knows the details because everyone is solving the same
  problem. Do not assume that professor knows all details.

- Evaluation. How do you know your solution actually works? How do you
  know you actually solve the problem you want to solve? Is your
  solution better than existing solutions? In what ways? Why?

- How does your solution fit into the work of your team? How will your
  work be integrated into the team's work? If your work is not
  integrated, it is lost and you waste time.

You definitely need practice. Do not imagine that you can speak well
without practice. You cannot. Do not intend to fool anyone. You
cannot.  You should follow the 1-10 rules: For every minute's
presentation, spend 10 minutes preparing. If your speech is 15
minutes, you should spend two and half hours preparing.

Make Effective Visual Aids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to provide details. Use figures, drawings, photos, equations,
screenshots, source code ... to explain.  Here are some principle in
making visual aids:

- If you can say it, do not put on the visual aids. Many students type a lot of words into their slides. These words are not effective.

- Anything you put in the slides must mean something important.  Do
  not put anything because "it looks nice". 

- If it is not readable, remove it. Anything smaller than 16 pt font is not readable.



It Does Not Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very common scenario is when a student tries a few things and does
not get expected results. During progress report, the student says
only one sentence, "My progress report is that I tried a few things
and they did not work."  This student does not understand the precious
information about

- What has been tried?

- Why are these things worth trying?

- What are the expected results? How to define "working"?

- What are the evidence "they did not work"?

- What information can be obtained from these activities? What lessons are learned?

- What actions will the student take next?

Most students do not know that the unexpected results (do not call
them "failure") form the foundation of new discoveries or invention.
The unexpected results provide precious information.

It is understandable that you encounter problems that are harder than
expected. It is understandable that your other commitment may prevent
you from making enough progress. It is understandable that unexpected
things happen. Be honest. If you have not made progress, tell the
truth. If something does not work, explain what happens.

Honesty, integrity, and trust are the foundation of research. Never lie. Never fake data.



Distinguish "Solving a Problem" from "Fixing a Solution"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Too often, people are confused between "solving a problem" and "fixing
a solution". Here are two examples explaining the differences.

Imagine that you are going to take a vacation and a friend will take
you to the airport. Several hours before your flight, your friend's
car breaks down.  You say, "I can fix your car." It turns out fixing
the car takes longer than expected and you miss the flight.  "How can
anyone be so stupid?", you may ask. "Too many".  The "problem" is that
you need transportation to the airport for your flight. One (among
many) solution is to ask this particular friend to give you a ride to
the airport. There are many other solutions for the problem (going to
the airport for the flight), such as asking another friend, taking a
bus, or calling a taxi. However, you completely focus on this
particular solution and want to fix the solution (repairing the car).

You want to make a graph showing the results from an experiment.  You
are very familiar with a computer tool. You recently purchase a new
computer and your familiar tool does not run on the new computer. You
spend several hours install, remove, install again this tool. You
search online why this tool does not run your new computer. You erase
the entire computer, install a new operating system, and install the
tool again. What is the problem? The problem is to show the
experimental results. Your familiar tool for making a graph is one
possible solution.  You spend several hours fixing this solution but
you can use many other possible solutions, such as making a table,
using another tool, or simply looking at the data and hand draw the
figure.

Ask yourself often whether you are solving a problem or fixing a
solution.  If it is the latter, are there other solutions? If there
are (usually there are), why do you stay with the current solution
that needs to be fixed? Can you choose another solution?


Put Down the Laser Pointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A laser pointer is bad.  Never touch the laser pointer.  When you use
a laser pointer, you have to turn your head to the screen and your
back to the audience. That's the first problem.  If you are nervous, a
laser pointer amplifies your shaking hand.  If you are really nervous,
you keep pressing the on button when you talk and shine the laser to
your audience. Some people lose their eyes and you are arrested.

If you speak in a large room with two or several screens, which screen
will you point to?

Nothing good can be said about a laser pointer. 

Use the computer's cursor.


How to Get Good Grades in Research?
-----------------------------------

Research is very very (very very) different from classroom
learning. Learning focuses on getting knowledge and skills into
you. Research focuses on creating something new, new to everyone in
the world, not new to you only. In many cases, classroom learning
means attending lectures, taking notes, read textbooks, submitting
homeworks, answering exam questions. It is possible getting a good
grade without saying a single word in a class.  Research has *none* of
these.  There is no lecture, textbooks, exam questions.  Instead, you
need to think about how to evaluate your work.  **Communication is
extremely important in research.**

Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Each person is expected to attend the weekly meetings. Absence must
  be reported to the team leader and Dr. Lu by email.  Having an exam
  is an acceptable reason **only** if the exam is held at the same
  time of the meeting. It is not acceptable if the exam is on the same
  day at a different time.

- During the weekly meetings, each person has to report progress for
  3-5 minutes: What has been done? Why should it be done? What is the
  result? Please provide details.  It is **not** acceptable saying "It
  does not work." as a progress report.

- Approximately near the middle of a semester, each person needs to
  give a presentation (8-10 minutes) explaining the problem.  The
  presentation must provide enough details, including the reason why
  this problem needs to be solved, the relationship between this
  problem and the team's goals, and the planned approach.

- Approximately near the middle of a semester, each person needs to
  fill a peer evaluation of the team members. This is an opportunity
  to find the members that have performed well or poorly.

- Before the semester ends, each person needs to give a presentation
  (15-20 minutes) about the results. This presentation needs to
  include three important things: (1) details, (2) details, and (3)
  details.  What has been done? How is the method evaluated? What are
  the results?  If something "works", please provide evidence. If
  something is "better", please provide detailed comparison.  If
  something "does not work", please provide diagnosis. Everyone has to
  practice in advance. Everything on every slide must be carefully
  explained.  It is acceptable if you include code, as long as you
  explain.  


One of the most important difference between doing class homework and
research is the need of **team thinking**. You are part of a team and
your must contribute to the team. Many students make significant
progress in their computers but they do not share what they have done
with the team. As a result, whatever they have done is restricted to
themselves.  What does it mean sharing work with the team? At the
minimum, each member should document contributions You need to clearly
document everything you want to do, you have done, and the results.
You are responsible explaining to the other group members that you are
doing. Your document must provide enough details so that other people
can reproduce your work.



How To Become a Team Leader
---------------------------

One of the spacial parts of this research team is the comprehensive
leadership development program. The experience of leading a research
team can define your career for many years after you graduate from
Purdue.

The CAM2 team has two types of leaders:

- Topic leader: A leader manages a specific topic (for example, active
  learning, drone video, crowdsourcing ...). A topic leader needs to
  know the topic's goal (write a research paper, build software,
  create data ...) and guide members toward the goal. A leader needs
  to know enough about different parts of the topic but does not need
  to know all details of everyone's work. A topic leader is a
  technical leader.

- CAM2 leader: "Leader of all leaders". The CAM2 team has multiple
  topics and the entire team needs a leader. The CAM2 leader needs to
  think about the entire team strategically, for example, how to
  recruit and screen new members and how to reorganize future
  projects. The CAM2 leader represents all topic leaders and
  communicate with the advisers. It is typical that the CAM2 leader is
  also a topic leader.

Benefits and Responsibilities of Leaders 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You get the opportunity to develop the skills that cannot be
  obtained in classrooms. In classrooms, most students are used to
  "mind their own business". Their success depends only on their own
  abilities and efforts. A leader's success depends on the team
  members. This is a completely different experience and requires new
  sets of skills.
  
- Leading a research topic or the entire research team gives you new
  prospects about how to interact with people (team members, other
  leaders, professors, external collaborators, sponsors ...).
  
- Leaders need to understand their members: their abilities, their
  long-term aspiration, their short-term constraints. Leaders need to
  understand the topic's and the team's needs, such as paper
  deadlines.
  
- A leader has to think about the project's needs and plan ahead.  If
  the research project writes a paper, the leader is by default the
  first author.  If it is a conference paper, the leader is the first
  choice to present the paper.
  
- If you need recommendation letters from the advisers, the letters
  will be much stronger.  By default, a leader's recommendation letter
  is one or two levels stronger than members.

- Talk to the advisers, often. The leaders are selected by the
  advisers. If you do not talk to the advisers, you will not be
  selected.  In most cases, new members are not leaders. A leader has
  to be in the project for at least one semester.

- Shape the directions of the projects. Leaders have greater
  opportunities suggesting projects' directions.


- Train new members. Explain the organizations, goals, and culture of
  this research team to new members
  Understand new members' expertise and determine the most appropriate tasks given to the new members

 


Suggestions to New Leaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include Everyone in Meeting
###########################

A leader has to ensure that everyone in the team is engaged in
meetings. New leaders sometimes get too excited about the progress by
a few members and ignore the others. This is particularly common when
a team has new members and returning members. Returning members are
more comfortable speaking in meetings sharing their progress. New
members feel that they have not made much progress and silence is
often their first option in meetings.

New members (still thinking as students) often incorrectly believe
that "Everyone knows everything. I cannot offer anything new to the
team."

A leader has to ensure that all members participate in meetings.
Several things can be done to achieve this:

- The leader limits the amount of time each person speaks. If someone
  (usually a returning member) has more to say, tell the person to
  summarize first.  Give everyone a chance to speak and then come back
  to this person for discussion.

- The leader may meet new members outside the team meeting
  time. Explain to them the expectation and help them identify the
  materials to present in meetings. Call their names in meetings.

- If anyone in the team wants to dominate the discussion (i.e., always
  talking without giving others opportunities to speak), the leader
  has to stop this person. If this person has the habit of dominating
  the discussion, communicate with this person outside the meeting.
  If this situation persists, inform the advisor to intervene.

Another common mistake of new leaders is to think everyone is equally
devoted to the team.  The truth is that some members may think this
project as a high priority, willing to spend 20 hours per week; some
others may think this project as one of many important things, maybe
10 hours per week; the others may think this project as a way to get
credits and graduate, spending as little time as possible.
A good leader has to take advantage of every member's talent, even though
some members can spend little time.

How to Get Strong Letters of Recommendation
-------------------------------------------

If you have taken ECE 264 with Dr.  Lu and you have no additional
interaction with him, he has a `Generic Recommendation Letter
<https://github.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/blob/master/source/document/ECE264SampleLetter.pdf>`__.
If you took his class but never talked to him, he knows nothing about
you and has nothing to recommend. Your grade is already in the
transcript. If the only thing Dr.  Lu can write is about your grade,
the letter does not help you.  As you can see, this is not a strong
letter.  If you want this letter, you must give Dr. Lu at least three
weeks to write your letter.  When you ask him to write, you must give
him a list of universities you want to apply. He will send letters to
only these universities. You must send all applications **within one
week**.  You are busy. Dr. Lu is also busy. Your problem is not his
problem.  If you do not like his policy, do not ask him for letters.

If you want a stronger letter, please keep reading.

Helping students succeed is one of the missions of university
professors. Dr. Lu writes recommendation letters for graduate schools,
awards, jobs, etc. Before you ask Dr. Lu to write a letter for you,
please ask yourself these question:

- Does Dr. Lu know me well?
- Do I have something special to be recommended?
- Can Dr. Lu write a strong letter for me?
- Does he have time writing a letter for me?

If you answer No to any question, STOP. Don't waste your time. 

`This video <https://youtu.be/VMnzmM93W0s>`__ explains how recommendation letters work for applications of graduate schools. Please watch.

Dr. Lu writes letters for a student only after talking to the
student. **If you want a letter from him, you have to talk to him.**
If you are not on Purdue campus, please schedule a video call.

Do not ask Dr. Lu to write a letter because you cannot find anyone
else. It is your problem, not Dr. Lu's.

Dr. Lu's letters always focus on accomplishments. You need to provide
evidence of your accomplishments. "I really enjoy your class" is not
an accomplishment and Dr. Lu cannot write a letter because a student
enjoys his class. "I do not know who else to ask" is not an
accomplishment and Dr. Lu cannot write a letter for this reason.

When you ask Dr. Lu for a letter, he will always ask you the following
questions (because graduate schools ask them). Please bring your
answers **with evidence** (such as your project reports).

- Your ability to speak and write. You can answer this question by
  giving an excellent technical presentation and a well-written
  technical document.

- Your ability to work in teams.

You must give Dr. Lu at least three weeks to write your letter.  When
you ask him to write, you must give him a list of universities you
want to apply. He will send letters to only these universities. You
must send all applications **within one week**.

You do not decide the content of the letters.  Dr. Lu will **never**
say anything if he has no supporting evidence. Dr. Lu will **never** sign a
letter written by you.

Some students think sending email to professors is the only needed
action for getting recommendation letters. This is not true for
Dr. Lu. Dr. Lu works with individual students and writes many details
in the letters. If you are unwilling spending time with him through
this process, do not ask him to write letters.  Every letter must have
a known destination.

You are busy. So is everyone.  Your time is precious. So is his.

If you need a letter, please fill `this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgJPMfgR7gFd5D1eJPAK7A7AfCGPYfgxzitH2A-3TNfyZmLw/viewform?usp=sf_link>`__. Please send email to Dr. Lu after you have filled the form.


How To Arrange Business Trips
-----------------------------

Please work with Emily Fuller <fuller87@purdue.edu> in MSEE 268 and Christy Millen <millenc@purdue.edu> in MSEE 112.

Please download
`Travel Form <https://github.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/blob/master/source/document/travelform.docx?raw=true>`__.

Purdue Rules about Travel:

- `Air Travel <https://www.purdue.edu/business/travel/Transportation/Air_Travel/airfaretravel.html>`__

- `Lodging <https://www.purdue.edu/business/travel/Lodging/index.html>`__

- `Ground Transportation <https://www.purdue.edu/business/travel/Transportation/Car/index.html>`__

  
Some general principles in arranging trips:

- Use your judgment. Balance among safety, convenience, comfort, and cost.

- Use money wisely. Do not think "This is not my money. I am going to
  spend as much as possible." Research fund is not easy to get. If you
  spend too much money on travel, less money can be used for other
  things (such as a new machine or another business trip).

- Your time is precious. Do not spend a lot of time looking for cheap
  airfare or inexpensive hotels. Do not choose a cheap hotel that
  requires long commute to your business destination. Do not choose a
  very long over to save a few dollars.

- Safety is your highest priority.  If you feel unsafe, take
  reasonable actions to reduce the chance of harm (stay in the
  conference hotel, call a taxi, ...)

- Take advantage of the local opportunities. Can you visit a
  collaborator or a sponsor in the same city?

- Make as many friends as possible.  The main reason for you to travel
  is to meet people. Talk to them. Learn what they are doing. Ask them
  questions. Do not hide at corners and wish you are invisible (many
  students do that). You will not be eaten if you say, "Hello, I am
  from Purdue University. Can you tell me more about your recent
  research?"


How To Write a Research Paper
-----------------------------

First, forget everything about your "semester papers". These are not
real research papers.  A research paper typically takes one or two
*years* (not weeks, not months) to write. If you want to write a
research paper quickly, this team is not for you.

Books to Read
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to write papers, please read these three books:

- Academic Writing for Graduate Students: Essential Tasks and Skills by John M. Swales and Christine B. Feak

- Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace by Joseph M. Williams and Joseph Bizup

- The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R. Tufte

If you want to be successful, you should learn efficiently. One way to
learn is to read books.  Some students do not read these books and
want to "learn from mistakes". This is inefficient and extremely
stupid.  It is like you jumping out from a tall building, break a leg,
and say, "Oh, gravity exists" or putting your hand in a flame and say,
"Oh, that hurts."

Some students say, "I have learned writing in high school."  What you
learned is not "technical writing" and is not helpful. In fact, many
students learn wrong things.  Some students say, "This is different
from what my teacher at high school taught me."  Do you know how many
research paper the teacher has published?  If the answer is zero (or a
few), please forget what the teacher told you.

Before writing a research paper, it is important to understand the
purpose.  If you are doing real research, you must be doing something
new
and you are the only person knowing what is going on. You have write
down the details so that others can understand.  The most common
mistake when students write papers is that they misunderstand the
purpose of research papers.  They believe that everyone is doing the
same thing (like all students doing the same homework) and there is no
need to explain anything.

A research paper is *not* a place you show off tricks of grammar.  You
should keep the writing as simple as possible: The English is easy to
understand, even though the content may be difficult. Do not write
long sentences. If a sentence has three or more verbs, you should
consider to shorten it or break it into several sentences.

Dr. Lu has published many research papers and he knows how to write
research papers. He will not discuss with you about how to write
papers.  He will not accept your suggestions.  Dr. Lu does not need
your advice about how to write research papers.  Do not waste time
teaching him how to write papers.

**If you disagree, leave.**


Types of Papers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Roughly speaking, there are four types of research papers.

- Research papers: Present a new solution, a new problem, a new
  interpretation of existing knowledge, etc.  The key here is **new**.
  The target readers are people investigating the same or similar
  research topics.  A good research paper should provide enough
  details so that experts in this topic can learn something. A good
  research paper should also have enough overview and references so
  that new researchers can follow the paper. A good research paper may
  be read by a few thousand people.  Most new researchers (i.e., you)
  start by writing such papers.

- Magazine papers: These papers target a wider audience that is not
  doing the same research topic.  These papers are usually color and
  have good visual aids: figures, images, drawings, tables ....
  Magazine papers may be read by many thousand people.

- Survey or tutorial papers: Provide overviews about specific
  topics. These papers help new researchers in these topics. Survey
  papers are usually more technical than magazine papers.  A survey
  paper often refers 50 or more papers and writing such a papers would
  be difficult for new researchers.  A good survey is more than
  listing what has been done; a good survey paper identifies what is
  common among existing work and suggests directions for future
  improvements.

- Vision papers: Inform the research community what topics to work on
  in the next ten years. New researchers rarely write vision papers
  because new researchers do not know the research community enough.

Structure of Research Papers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rest of this section focuses on research papers that present
something new.  Please focus on the word **new**.  A good research
paper should have the following components:

Title
#####

Obviously, the title is the first thing readers see.  Usually, a title
has only one or two lines. Please choose every word in the title
carefully. This is the first impression to readers. This is the most
precious real estate in the entire paper. Make sure every word means
something important to readers.  Obviously, the first word in the
title is extremely important. Think carefully about what word you want
to use.

Some students love to create interesting acronyms and put the acronyms
as the very first word in a title. This is *unwise* because the
acronym probably means nothing to readers.  For this research team,
**you must not use an acronym** in the title because every word must
mean something important to readers (not authors). 

Authors and Affiliations
########################

Who has contributed to this paper? Different areas treat authors in
different ways.  Some areas order authors by last names
alphabetically. Some areas order authors by contributions- the first
author has the most contributions. Some areas put students first,
ordered by contributions, and professors last.  This research team
adopts the convention of ordering authors by contributions and
students are listed before professors.  Each author's affiliation
should be clearly described. For conference papers, usually emails are
also included.  Please use your *official* business email addresses
(i.e., @purdue.edu), not @gmail, @hotmail, or anything like that.

Abstract
########
  
An abstract has about 12 sentences and 200 words with the following structure:

- Problem (2 sentences)

- Existing work and deficiencies (2-3 sentences)

- Your method and why it is better (3-5 sentences)

- Evaluation methods (2-3 sentence)

- Results and comparison (2-3 sentences)

Introduction
############

The introduction is approximately 15% of the paper.  An introduction
usually has four or five paragraphs:

1. Big picture. What is this whole thing about? 
   
2. Description of the problem to be solved in this paper and related
   work. What has been done?  This paragraph cites some papers.  The
   end of this paragraph describes what is wrong in existing work, as
   a way to get ready for the next paragraph.
   
3. Your solution and why it is better. This paragraph should start
   with "This paper presents a solution ...."  This must be a new
   paragraph.  Help readers understand your paper quickly.  You need
   to use active voice here.  Some students say, "Technical papers
   must use passive voice." These students are wrong.
   
4. (optional) [More details about your solution]
   
5. Evaluation, comparison, and results.  If your solution is not
   better, do not write a paper.

6. Summary of contributions.   
   
7. (optional) Implications
   
8. (optional) [Structure of the paper] "This paper is organized as
   follows ..." This is needed only if the paper is longer than 8
   pages.

Related Work
############

This section is appxominately 10% of the paper.  This section should
cite recent papers that solve the same problems or related problems.
It is advised to cite papers in the same community (same conference,
same journal) as the venue you are about to submit to.  If you do not
cite any paper in the community, why do you submit a paper to this
community?

This section servers several purposes: First, inform the readers what
has been done. If you are a new researcher, you also want to show that
"you have done your homework".  You do not want readers to say, "This
paper is meaningless because the authors have not read papers XXX and
YYY."  Second, you position your paper to be a peer among the cited
papers.  Third, after describing what has been done, you can explain
your contributions in the proper context.  You can compare your method
with existing methods.

At the end of this section, you may want to create a table summarizing
the difference.  Many papers also provide more details about the
contributions, with comparison of the cited work.  Please be aware
that "work" is not countable. You must not say, "previous works".

Your Solution
#############

This is the place where you explain your solution. Give a meaningful
title describing your method. 


How To Give a Technical Presentation
------------------------------------

The BIGGEST problem when students present their projects is the
"student thinking": "Everyone is doing exactly the same homework. I do
not need to explain what I am doing and why I am doing it. Everyone should
already know."

Please take *every* presentation seriously.  You must understand that
each presentation is as important as an exam and you should spend **at
least** four hours preparing each presentation.  Important decisions
are made based on your presentations. Dr. Lu uses your presentations
in making decisions that may have profound impacts in your career, for
example,

- Your grade.

- Selection of team leaders. 

- Recommendation letters. 

- Nominations of awards. 

- Collaboration with industry partners.

- Financial supports to conferences.

A good presentation must have deep technical content **and**
well-polished delivery.

If you do not know how to give a good presentation, take a class, join
a speaking club, join toastmasters ....

When you prepare a presentation, please follow this format:

- Give a meaningful title. The title should **not** be "Progress",
  "Final Presentation", "Update", "CAM2 Report", ...  The title should
  describe your work in a meaningful way.

- Your name.   

- The problem your team is solving and the problem YOU are solving
  (not the entire team).  This is usually the weakest part of
  students' presentations. Many students cannot describe the problems
  because "the problems are given by the professors or the leaders".

- Your solution.

- Evaluation. Does your method work? Please make the evaluation
  **quantitative**.  Many students say, "It works." or "It does not
  work." What does that mean? In most scenarios, "working" depending
  on specific inputs.

  


If you want to make a video, you can use Camtasia. You can download
the

Spell acronyms.

Give meaningful title. The title cannot be "progress report", "semester report"

General rules: If you can say it, do not put words in the slides.
