Prospective Students
====================

The purpose of this section is to help prospective students understand
whether Dr. Lu's research team can meet your expectation.

For Graduate Students
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you consider to join Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu's research team, please
read this before you send an email. Doing so can save your time.

- Dr. Lu's research is about computer vision and embedded systems (how
  to make computer vision efficient so that it can run on embedeed
  systems). Dr. Lu does not conduct research in topics related to
  Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, or Quantum Computing.

- Do you know Dr. Lu's research topics? Have you read his recent papers?

- Do you want to do research? Research means creating new
  knowledge. Research is not about learning existing knowledge.  If
  your goal is to learn things, please take courses.  A research
  team does not meet your expectation.

- Dr. Lu advises graduate students only if they want to write MS or
  PhD theses with Dr. Lu.

- Dr. Lu can advise only (1) Purdue students, or (2) non-Purdue
  students whose advisors are collaborating with Dr. Lu.

- Dr. Lu has no authorization to admit any student. Do not ask him,
  "Can I get admission from Purdue?"

- If your purpose is to get money, please go to a bank. Dr. Lu does
  not own a bank.  


For Undergraduate Students
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- This is a research team. A research team's purpose is to discover
  new knowledge. Dr. Lu's research is about how to improve efficiency
  of computers.

- If your purpose is to learn and you do not want to create new
  knowledge, please take courses.
  
- Will you stay in his team for at least two semesters? Creating new
  knowledge is not easy. One semester is too short and nothing can be
  accomplished.  Writing a research paper usually takes two years.

- Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, this
  research team is not for you.

- You must explain your work to the other team members in speaking and
  writing.  If you absolutely hate to speak and write, this research
  team is not for you.

- If you want to get Dr. Lu recommendation letters, think about what
  you want to accomplish before he writes the letters. Dr. Lu's
  letters state observable facts, such as (1) whether you have
  published a research paper? (2) is your software used by anyone
  else? (3) have you create research data used by anyone else?

- Dr. Lu does not write letters that say anything like "This student
  works very hard" or "This student learns a lot" or "This student
  enjoys my class" or "This student smiles to everyone"

- Before Dr. Lu writes letters for you, he will ask you for your
  project reports and presentations. Make sure you keep these
  materials.

- Universities ask questions like "intellectual independence",
  "written English", "oral English", "maturity", "research ability",
  "teaching ability", "interpersonal skills", "reliability and sense
  of responsibility", "organization". If Dr. Lu does not know enough
  about you, he will answer "No information".

- If you have never talked to Dr. Lu, he knows nothing about you and
  cannot write recommendation letters for you.
