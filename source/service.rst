The `IEEE Low-Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC)
<https://lpcv.ai/>`_ is an international competition started in 2015
by Yung-Hsiang Lu (Purdue University) and Alexander C. Berg
(University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).  Nvidia and IEEE
Rebooting Computing were the first sponsors.  This competition
combines computer vision and low-power systems. The score is defined
as

.. math::
   \frac{\text{accuracy}}{\text{energy consumption}}

In 2015-2019, the accuracy was defined by object detection (similar to
ImageNet) and the competition was called the IEEE Low-Power Image
Recognition Challenge (LPIRC). In 2020, video was added and it was
renamed to Low-Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC).
Since 2015, the sponsors include

|PyTorch| |Google| |IEEERC| |Xilinx| |Nvidia|

|CAS| |NSF| |Mediatek| |CEDA| |ELAN|
