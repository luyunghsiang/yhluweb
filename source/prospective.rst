Prospective Students
====================

The purpose of this section is to help prospective students understand
whether Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu's research team can meet your expectation.
Dr. Lu advises both graduate and undergraduate students.

For Graduate Students
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you consider to join Dr. Lu's research team, please read this
before you send an email. Doing so can save your time.

- Dr. Lu's research is about computer vision and embedded systems (how
  to make computer vision efficient so that it can run on embedded
  systems). Dr. Lu does not conduct research in topics related to
  Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, or Quantum Computing.

- Research means creating new knowledge. Research is not about
  learning existing knowledge. Research is not about reading books or
  papers. If your goal is to learn things, please take courses.

- Creating new knowledge is difficult. It is necessary to focus on one
  topic only. If you investigate multiple topics, you cannot make any
  progress.

- Honesty is the foundation of science. Quality is always more
  important than quantity.

- Dr. Lu sets a research direction and expects each student to develop
  a plan. He does not micro-manage students on daily basis.

- Dr. Lu advises graduate students only if they want to write MS or
  PhD theses with Dr. Lu. 

- Dr. Lu can advise only (1) Purdue students, or (2) non-Purdue
  students whose advisors are collaborating with Dr. Lu.

- Dr. Lu has no authorization to admit any student. Do not ask him,
  "Can I get admission from Purdue?"

- Before you send email to Dr. Lu, read his recent papers. He will not
  answer your email if the email does not mention any of his papers.

- Financial support for graduate students is based on available
  funding and research ability. Financial support will be discussed
  after there is mutual interest doing research together.

- Please fill `this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLsPz1JUVo8_b2Jb2WuVCBbpWhUcgLjXC_bEW3CPOhHj-4w/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_. Thank you.


For Undergraduate Students
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- This is a research team. A research team's purpose is to discover
  new knowledge. Dr. Lu's research is about how to improve efficiency
  of computers.

- If your purpose is to learn and you do not want to create new
  knowledge, please take courses.
  
- Will you stay in this team for at least two semesters? Creating new
  knowledge is not easy. One semester is too short and nothing can be
  accomplished.

- Writing a research paper usually takes two years.

- This team has a strong record and high expectations. Many past
  members published research papers in peer-reviewed journals or
  conferences. Many members became graduate students in top
  universities. Multiple members received "Honorable Mentions" as
  Outstanding Undergraduate Researchers by the Computing Research
  Association.  Some members won business competitions.  Some members
  started companies and successfully raised fund before they
  graduated. One member received the Graduate Research Fellowship from
  the National Science Foundation.

- If you join this team, you will work with exceptional students. You
  must expect yourself to be exceptional as well.

- Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, this
  research team is not for you.

- You must explain your work to the other team members in speaking and
  writing.  If you absolutely hate to speak and write, this research
  team is not for you.

- If you want to get Dr. Lu recommendation letters, think about what
  you want to accomplish before he writes the letters. Dr. Lu's
  letters state observable facts, such as (1) whether you have
  published a research paper? (2) is your software used by anyone
  else? (3) have you created research data used by anyone else?

- Dr. Lu does not write letters that say anything like "This student
  works very hard" or "This student learns a lot" or "This student
  enjoys my class" or "This student smiles to everyone".

- Before Dr. Lu writes letters for you, he will ask you for your
  project reports and presentations. Make sure you keep these
  materials.

- Universities ask questions like "intellectual independence",
  "written English", "oral English", "maturity", "research ability",
  "teaching ability", "interpersonal skills", "reliability and sense
  of responsibility", "organization". If Dr. Lu does not know enough
  about you, he will answer "No information".

- If you have never talked to Dr. Lu, he knows nothing about you and
  cannot write recommendation letters for you.
