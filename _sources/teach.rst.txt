- ECE 595 "`Computer Vision for Embedded Systems
  <https://www.edx.org/course/computer-vision-for-embedded-systems>`_".
  Fall 2021 and 2022. This is an experimental course. This course
  provides an overview of running computer vision (OpenCV and PyTorch)
  on an embedded system (Raspberry PI). The course emphasizes the
  resource constraints imposed by embedded systems and examines
  methods (such as quantization and pruning) to reduce resource
  requirements. This course was offered in Spring 2022 as a Guest
  Lecturer (Sabbatical Visit) in "Special Topics in Machine
  Intelligence, Seoul National University"

- Fall 2021  "`ECE 264 Advanced C Programming
  <https://github.com/PurdueECE264>`_". Topics covered: stack memory,
  recursion, memory management, structures, file (text and binary),
  dynamic structures (linked list and binary tree). Tools: gcc, gcov,
  Makefile, gdb, valgrind. Lecture videos are available `here
  <https://engineering.purdue.edu/OOSD/F2020>`_.

- VIP ("`Vertically Integrated Projects
  <https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/index_html>`_"). VIP teams
  mix students from cohorts (first-year undergraduate to doctoral) and
  conduct research. Dr. Lu advises the following teams:

  * Fall 2022 "`Computer Vision for Embedded Systems
    <https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/computer-vision-for-embedded-systems>`_":
    improve efficiency (inference time, training time, storage space,
    energy consumption) of computer vision (both image and multimedia)
    so that computer vision can run on embedded systems. The team will
    evaluate how existing methods (such as quantization and pruning)
    can be applied to new neural architectures (such as
    transformers). The team will also investigate new architectures of
    neural networks and compare their efficiency with different levels
    of accuracy. Advisor: Yung-Hsiang Lu.
    
  
  * Fall 2021 "`Analyze Drone Video
    <https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/dronevideo>`_": creates
    a dataset captured by drone (also called UAV, unmanned aerial
    vehicle) and a referee system that can evaluate the accuracy and
    performance (execution time) of different solutions. Sponsor:
    Facebook - Pytorch. Advisors: Qiang Qiu, Yung-Hsiang Lu, and Wei
    Zakharov.


  * Fall 2021 "`Open-Source TensorFlow Software
    <https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/tensorflow>`_": Creates
    software to be used in the `TensorFlow 2 Model Garden
    <https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/introducing-model-garden-for-tensorflow-2.html>`_
    as examples.  Sponsor: Google. Advisors: James Davis and
    Yung-Hsiang Lu

  * Spring 2021 "`Image Processing for Solar Sail
    <https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/sail>`_": 
    Creates the software to analyze the images taken by the camera on
    a spacecraft using solar sail. Sponsor: NASA. Advisors: Alina
    Alexeenko, Anthony Cofer, Yung Hsiang Lu.

  * Spring 2021 "`Program Analysis as a Service
    <https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/program-analysis-as-a-service>`_":
    Creates an online service that analyzes computer programs to help
    students learn programming.  Advisors: Aravind Machiry and
    Yung-Hsiang Lu.
