<section id="common-mistakes-of-beginning-researchers">
<h2>Common Mistakes of Beginning Researchers<a class="headerlink" href="#common-mistakes-of-beginning-researchers" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Many beginning researchers make similar mistakes. Here is a list of
some common mistakes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“It has been done before.” “I must be the first.”  Many beginning
researchers immediately reject a research topic because someone has
done something related. These beginning researchers do not
yet have the ability to think deeply.  If a problem is
important, some people must have done some things related.  If
nobody has ever done anything about a research topic, this topic is
not worth doing.</p></li>
<li><p>“I want to learn. I do not want to create anything.”  Learning is
not the purpose of doing research. The purpose research is to
discover new knowledge for other researchers. Many beginning
researchers learn some new things and then stop. They have not
created new knowledge and thus they have not accomplished anything
yet.</p></li>
<li><p>“If I understand, my research is done.”  Researchers need to explain
their discoveries in writing and speaking. If the new knowledge is
not disseminated, research is incomplete.</p></li>
<li><p>“I need to have an idea (solution) before I start.” This sentence is
self-contradictory. Research is a process to find solutions (more
specifically, better solutions).</p></li>
<li><p>“I must build everything myself.” It is not possible to do research
if a researcher wants to build everything from nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>“I have to read every paper before I start.”  This is not
possible. Instead, a beginning researcher should identify and read
important papers. After reading these papers, the researcher should
follow a few papers closely. Reproducing the results in these papers
will be a better way than reading many more papers.</p></li>
<li><p>“If it does not work perfectly, it is not worth doing.” Research
often improves existing solutions by a little amount each time. Some
beginning researchers are eager to say, “This will not work.”
Instead, they should say, “I will make some improvements.”</p></li>
<li><p>“If I have a solution, my work is done.” Researchers have
responsibilities explaining their discoveries. After finding
solutions, researchers need to write papers and present their work.</p></li>
<li><p>“If I fail, I will change topics.” Failures are common in
research. The only way to succeed in research is to continue
improving (through discussing with other researchers, reading
literature, experimenting new methods, etc.). Many beginning
researchers stop when they encounter difficulties.</p></li>
<li><p>“I don’t know what I want. I am going to try many things.”  Research
has many stages, including (1) identify problems, (2) study existing
work, (3) determine the needed improvements, (4) improve existing
methods, (5) evaluate the new methods, (6) explain the discoveries.
If a beginning researcher changes topics too often, this researcher
does not have opportunities going through these stages and does not
really have true experience being a researcher.</p></li>
<li><p>“I don’t want to become a professor. I don’t need to do research.”
or “I do not want to go to a graduate program. I do not need to do
research.”  Research is a style of thinking. Researchers want to
create new knowledge to fulfill their curiosity.  Many people do
research even though they do not attend graduate programs.</p></li>
<li><p>“If I use many acronyms and technical terms, nobody can understand
and people think I am very smart.”  The truth is the
opposite. People respect you better if you can explain things
clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>“I need to do research so that people think I am smart.” Many smart
people do not do research.  Why do you care whether people think you
are smart?</p></li>
<li><p>“I do not care about the research project after I leave the team.”
Research teams can last many years and the people you work with can
be your life-long friends as well as references for career
opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>“I do not need to document my work because I remember everything.”
You cannot remember everything. Even if you could remember
everything, your work does not exist without documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>“I do not need to document or explain because nobody cares what I
do.” If nobody cares, this topic is not worth doing.</p></li>
<li><p>“I want to work alone.”  If a beginning researchers works alone, it
is very difficult to make progress. It is better to work in a team
and help each other.</p></li>
<li><p>“I will choose a topic that interests me. I do not care what other
researchers in the same team are doing.”  A research team usually
has specific directions, strength, as well as accumulated expertise
and resources. A beginning researcher should take advantage of the
team.</p></li>
<li><p>“Professors should know everything.” Some beginning researchers
believe that professors should know everything.  The truth is that
professors usually do not know the details of every project.  If
professors know the details, the professors will likely move to
different topics. Thus, professors usually select research topics
that require further investigation by beginning researchers (usually
students).</p></li>
<li><p>“Their topics are easier than mine.” Many beginning researchers want
to change topics often because they always feel others’ topics are
easier. After they change topics, they find their topics too
difficult and want to change.</p></li>
<li><p>“I need to do everything myself, from the very beginning.”  Some
beginning researchers think they must do everything from the very
beginning. They want to rebuild things; they want to rewrite
software; they want to “start from scratch”.</p></li>
<li><p>“People should know why my project is important and feel equally
excited.” Some beginning researchers do not understand how to
explain the importance of their topics.  These researchers jump
directly to technical details.</p></li>
<li><p>“My work is not important.” Some beginning researchers think their
projects are unimportant. The questions is why these beginning
researchers spend time on these projects.</p></li>
<li><p>“Give me money first. Then, I will consider to talk to you.” Some
beginning researchers consider to discuss research only after
receiving financial support.  This is not a good strategy to
succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>“A professor teaches for three hours a week and does nothing else.”
Some beginning researchers do not understand what professors
do. They do understand professors’ responsibilities.  This is what
Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu’s activities in a typical week: (a) meet other
professors about research projects, collaborations, papers; (b) meet
students on research projects about papers, presentations, oral
exams, plans of studies; (c) teach in lectures, meet teaching
assistants, meet students in office hours, give career advice,
design future course; (d) write research proposals; (e) meet project
sponsors; (f) review research papers and proposals.  Dr. Lu also
attends conferences to present research discoveries and to learn the
discoveries by other researchers.</p></li>

<h2>For Graduate Students<a class="headerlink" href="#for-graduate-students" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you consider to join Dr. Lu’s research team, please read this
before you send an email. Doing so can save your time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dr. Lu’s research is about computer vision and embedded systems (how
to make computer vision efficient so that it can run on embedded
systems). Dr. Lu does not conduct research in topics related to
Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, or Quantum Computing.</p></li>
<li><p>Research means creating new knowledge. Research is not about
learning existing knowledge. Research is not about reading books or
papers. If your goal is to learn things, please take courses.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating new knowledge is difficult. It is necessary to focus on one
topic only. If you investigate multiple topics, you cannot make any
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Honesty is the foundation of science. Quality is always more
important than quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu sets a research direction and expects each student to develop
a plan. He does not micro-manage students on daily basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu advises graduate students only if they want to write MS or
PhD theses with Dr. Lu.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu can advise only (1) Purdue students, or (2) non-Purdue
students whose advisors are collaborating with Dr. Lu.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has no authorization to admit any student. Do not ask him,
“Can I get admission from Purdue?”</p></li>
<li><p>Before you send email to Dr. Lu, read his recent papers. He will not
answer your email if the email does not mention any of his papers.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial support for graduate students is based on available
funding and research ability. Financial support will be discussed
after there is mutual interest doing research together.</p></li>
<li><p>Please fill <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLsPz1JUVo8_b2Jb2WuVCBbpWhUcgLjXC_bEW3CPOhHj-4w/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a>. Thank you.</p></li>

<h2>For Undergraduate Students<a class="headerlink" href="#for-undergraduate-students" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you are an undergraduate student, <a class="reference external" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP">Vertically Integrated Projects
(VIP)</a> is the best way to start
research. If you have any question about VIP, please visit <a class="reference external" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/AboutUs/contact_us">this
website</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This is a research team. A research team’s purpose is to discover
new knowledge. Dr. Lu’s research is about how to improve efficiency
of computers.</p></li>
<li><p>If your purpose is to learn and you do not want to create new
knowledge, please take courses.</p></li>
<li><p>Will you stay in this team for at least two semesters? Creating new
knowledge is not easy. One semester is too short and nothing can be
accomplished.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a research paper usually takes two years.</p></li>
<li><p>This team has a strong record and high expectations. Many past
members published research papers in peer-reviewed journals or
conferences. Many members became graduate students in top
universities. Multiple members received “Honorable Mentions” as
Outstanding Undergraduate Researchers by the Computing Research
Association.  Some members won business competitions.  Some members
started companies and successfully raised fund before they
graduated. One member received the Graduate Research Fellowship from
the National Science Foundation.</p></li>
<li><p>If you join this team, you will work with exceptional students. You
must expect yourself to be exceptional as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, this
research team is not for you.</p></li>
<li><p>You must explain your work to the other team members in speaking and
writing.  If you absolutely hate to speak and write, this research
team is not for you.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to get Dr. Lu recommendation letters, think about what
you want to accomplish before he writes the letters. Dr. Lu’s
letters state observable facts, such as (1) whether you have
published a research paper? (2) is your software used by anyone
else? (3) have you created research data used by anyone else?</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu does not write letters that say anything like “This student
works very hard” or “This student learns a lot” or “This student
enjoys my class” or “This student smiles to everyone”.</p></li>
<li><p>Before Dr. Lu writes letters for you, he will ask you for your
project reports and presentations. Make sure you keep these
materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Universities ask questions like “intellectual independence”,
“written English”, “oral English”, “maturity”, “research ability”,
“teaching ability”, “interpersonal skills”, “reliability and sense
of responsibility”, “organization”. If Dr. Lu does not know enough
about you, he will answer “No information”.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have never talked to Dr. Lu, he knows nothing about you and
cannot write recommendation letters for you.</p></li>
