<h1>Prospective Students<a class="headerlink" href="#prospective-students" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this section is to help prospective students understand
whether Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu’s research team can meet your expectation.
Dr. Lu advises both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<section id="for-graduate-students">
<h2>For Graduate Students<a class="headerlink" href="#for-graduate-students" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you consider to join Dr. Lu’s research team, please read this
before you send an email. Doing so can save your time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dr. Lu’s research is about computer vision and embedded systems (how
to make computer vision efficient so that it can run on embedded
systems). Dr. Lu does not conduct research in topics related to
Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, or Quantum Computing.</p></li>
<li><p>Research means creating new knowledge. Research is not about
learning existing knowledge. Research is not about reading books or
papers. If your goal is to learn things, please take courses.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating new knowledge is difficult. It is necessary to focus on one
topic only. If you investigate multiple topics, you cannot make any
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Honesty is the foundation of science. Quality is always more
important than quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu sets a research direction and expects each student to develop
a plan. He does not micro-manage students on daily basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu advises graduate students only if they want to write MS or
PhD theses with Dr. Lu.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu can advise only (1) Purdue students, or (2) non-Purdue
students whose advisors are collaborating with Dr. Lu.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has no authorization to admit any student. Do not ask him,
“Can I get admission from Purdue?”</p></li>
<li><p>Before you send email to Dr. Lu, read his recent papers. He will not
answer your email if the email does not mention any of his papers.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial support for graduate students is based on available
funding and research ability. Financial support will be discussed
after there is mutual interest doing research together.</p></li>
<li><p>Please fill <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLsPz1JUVo8_b2Jb2WuVCBbpWhUcgLjXC_bEW3CPOhHj-4w/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a>. Thank you.</p></li>

<section id="for-undergraduate-students">
<h2>For Undergraduate Students<a class="headerlink" href="#for-undergraduate-students" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you are an undergraduate student, <a class="reference external" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP">Vertically Integrated Projects
(VIP)</a> is the best way to start
research. If you have any question about VIP, please visit <a class="reference external" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/AboutUs/contact_us">this
website</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This is a research team. A research team’s purpose is to discover
new knowledge. Dr. Lu’s research is about how to improve efficiency
of computers.</p></li>
<li><p>If your purpose is to learn and you do not want to create new
knowledge, please take courses.</p></li>
<li><p>Will you stay in this team for at least two semesters? Creating new
knowledge is not easy. One semester is too short and nothing can be
accomplished.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a research paper usually takes two years.</p></li>
<li><p>This team has a strong record and high expectations. Many past
members published research papers in peer-reviewed journals or
conferences. Many members became graduate students in top
universities. Multiple members received “Honorable Mentions” as
Outstanding Undergraduate Researchers by the Computing Research
Association.  Some members won business competitions.  Some members
started companies and successfully raised fund before they
graduated. One member received the Graduate Research Fellowship from
the National Science Foundation.</p></li>
<li><p>If you join this team, you will work with exceptional students. You
must expect yourself to be exceptional as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, this
research team is not for you.</p></li>
<li><p>You must explain your work to the other team members in speaking and
writing.  If you absolutely hate to speak and write, this research
team is not for you.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to get Dr. Lu recommendation letters, think about what
you want to accomplish before he writes the letters. Dr. Lu’s
letters state observable facts, such as (1) whether you have
published a research paper? (2) is your software used by anyone
else? (3) have you created research data used by anyone else?</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu does not write letters that say anything like “This student
works very hard” or “This student learns a lot” or “This student
enjoys my class” or “This student smiles to everyone”.</p></li>
<li><p>Before Dr. Lu writes letters for you, he will ask you for your
project reports and presentations. Make sure you keep these
materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Universities ask questions like “intellectual independence”,
“written English”, “oral English”, “maturity”, “research ability”,
“teaching ability”, “interpersonal skills”, “reliability and sense
of responsibility”, “organization”. If Dr. Lu does not know enough
about you, he will answer “No information”.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have never talked to Dr. Lu, he knows nothing about you and
cannot write recommendation letters for you.</p></li>
